OpenCV in C++ for image processing labs UVT

This are just some simple digital image processing algs implemented in c++ using OpenCV to open and manipulate images.
    
Detecting edges in images(using detectors)
   
The source is structured like this:

data (images used)
Algorithms:
    noise:
        add:
            Gaussian noise
            Salt & pepper
        remove:
            Mean filter
            Median filter
     detect edges:
         prewit detector
         sobel detector
        
    segmentation:
        adaptive thresholding
